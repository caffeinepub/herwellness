# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a visible Instagram link to the site header (desktop and mobile) and standardize the Instagram URL in site configuration.

**Planned changes:**
- Update site configuration to set the canonical Instagram URL to https://www.instagram.com/herwellness_2026/.
- Add an “Instagram” link to the desktop header primary navigation that uses the configured Instagram URL and opens in a new tab with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.
- Add an “Instagram” link to the mobile menu that uses the same configured Instagram URL and opens in a new tab with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.
- Ensure existing header navigation items remain unchanged and functional, and the footer Instagram link continues to use the configured URL.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can click an “Instagram” link from both the desktop header and mobile menu to open the HerWellness Instagram page in a new tab.
