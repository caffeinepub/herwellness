REQ-16 is partially evidenced: SITE_CONFIG.instagram.url is set to the required canonical URL, and the header uses it; however, there is no diff evidence that the footer uses the same configuration value or that its Instagram link was updated/verified.",

      "reason": "The diff shows SITE_CONFIG updated and SiteHeader consuming SITE_CONFIG.instagram.url, but there are no changes shown for SiteFooter and no direct evidence that the footer link uses SITE_CONFIG.instagram.url or that it now points to the updated URL.",
